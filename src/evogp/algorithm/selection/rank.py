    RankSelection implements a selection strategy based on fitness rank and selection pressure.

    Individuals are sorted by fitness, and their selection probabilities are calculated using the following formula:
    
    $$ P(R_i) = \frac{1}{n} \left( 1 + sp \left(1 - \frac{2i}{n-1}\right) \right) \quad \text{for } 0 \leq i \leq n-1, \quad 0 \leq sp \leq 1 $$

        - `n` is the population size,
        - `i` is the individual's rank,
        - `sp` represents the selection pressure (higher values correspond to greater pressure).
    
    Individuals are then selected with replacement based on these probabilities.
