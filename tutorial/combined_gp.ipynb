    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "### 1.1 What is a CombinedTree?\n",
    "A **CombinedTree** is an individual tree-based model that follows a _manually specified_ computation rule (a formula) but is split into multiple parts (sub-trees). Each part is an independent tree evolved by the genetic algorithm. For example, if you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "formula = lambda A, B, C: A + B * C\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `A`, `B`, and `C` are considered separate sub-trees, each evolved independently.\n",
    "- The final output of the CombinedTree is computed by substituting the outputs of sub-trees `A`, `B`, `C` into the formula (`A + B * C`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 What is a CombinedForest?\n",
    "A **CombinedForest** is simply a _population_ of CombinedTrees. Since EvoGP is a population-based genetic programming framework, we often manipulate and evaluate populations (forests) as the central objects rather than individual solutions (trees). \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, practically, we usually:\n",
    "1. Define a **CombinedForest** which internally maintains multiple sub-forests (one for each parameter).\n",
    "2. Evolve it via the usual genetic operators (selection, crossover, mutation) in EvoGP.\n"

    "## 2. How to Create a CombinedForest\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a **CombinedForest**, there are three important elements to provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Formula** (the computation rule).\n",
    "2. **Descriptors** (the blueprint that controls how each sub-tree is generated and mutated).\n",
    "3. **Population size** (`pop_size`).\n",
    "4. **share_input** (Whether all patterns in the formula share the same input, currently it **MUST be True**)"

    "### 2.1 Defining a Formula\n",
    "A formula must be a Python callable (e.g., `lambda`) that:\n",
    "- Has _at least one_ parameter.  \n",
    "- Uses only supported operations (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, or certain PyTorch math functions like `torch.pow`, `torch.tan`, etc.) to combine the parameters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "formula = lambda A, B, C: A + B * C\n",
    "```\n",

    "**Descriptors** in EvoGP define how trees (individuals) are generated and mutated. Each parameter in your formula corresponds to one descriptor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single Descriptor**: You can pass one `GenerateDiscriptor` object if you want _all parameters_ (`A`, `B`, `C`, ...) to be generated with the same rules.\n",
    "- **List of Descriptors**: If you need different rules for each parameter, supply a list of descriptors, one per formula parameter.\n",

    "\n",
    "In EvoGP, after you create a **CombinedForest**, you typically feed it into a genetic algorithm pipeline. This pipeline handles:\n",
    "1. **Selection**: how individuals are chosen for breeding (or carried forward as elites). \n",
    "2. **Crossover**: how two individuals exchange parts of their trees.\n",

    "\n",
    "Once you have evolved a best solution (or a set of solutions), you can:\n",
    "- Access each parameter sub-tree directly (e.g., `best.A`, `best.B`, `best.C`).\n",
    "- Convert these sub-trees into **sympy expressions** by calling `.to_sympy_expr()`.\n",
    "- Convert the **entire** CombinedTree into a Sympy expression using `combined_tree.to_sympy_expr(SYMPY_FORMULA)`, which will apply your top-level formula to each sub-tree's Sympy form.\n",
